## Iridium

### About

- **System:** NixOS + Zen kernel + Lanzaboote (Secure Boot) + NVIDIA drivers + CUDA
- **Disk:** LUKS2 (argon2id, iter-time 5000) → btrfs subvolumes
- **Impermanence:** Rollback service wipes `@` and `@home` on every boot; declared portions of state persist at `/persist`
- **Rehomify:** Standalone home-manager configuration(s) reapplied on boot via [Rehomify](https://github.com/Ryokune/rehomify)
- **Secrets:** sops-nix/age, age key derived from SSH host key at `/var/lib/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`
- **Network:** NetworkManager + DHCP + Tailscale (tag:iridium)

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> `iridium/disks.nix` targets `/dev/nvme0n1`. Verify your drive with `lsblk` and adjust if needed.

In the NixOS installer:

```bash
passwd nixos # use a 7+ word passphrase
```

From your dev machine:

```bash
# replace TARGET_IP
ssh nixos@TARGET_IP
```

While SSH'd into the installer:

```bash
sudo -i
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jx-wi/vessel.git
nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run nixpkgs#disko -- --mode destroy,format,mount vessel/iridium/disks.nix
```

```bash
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt --no-filesystems --dir vessel/iridium
mkdir -p /mnt/persist/etc/nixos
cp -a vessel/. /mnt/persist/etc/nixos
nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run nixpkgs#sbctl -- create-keys
mkdir -p /mnt/var/lib
mkdir -p /mnt/persist/var/lib
cp -r /var/lib/sbctl /mnt/var/lib/
cp -r /var/lib/sbctl /mnt/persist/var/lib/
nixos-install --flake /mnt/persist/etc/nixos#iridium
exit
```

```bash
exit
```

After the second `exit`, inject the SSH host key from your dev machine (with age key loaded):

> [!NOTE]
> sops-nix derives its age decryption key from the SSH host key. The key must exist before first boot or sops cannot decrypt any secret — including the user password and Tailscale auth key. On Iridium, `/var/lib` lives under impermanence persistence, so the injection target is `/mnt/persist/var/lib/ssh/` rather than `/mnt/etc/ssh/`.

```bash
# replace REPO_DIR and TARGET_IP
cd REPO_DIR

sops --extract '["ssh_host_ed25519_key"]' -d secrets/iridium/ssh.yaml \
  | ssh nixos@TARGET_IP \
    "sudo mkdir -p /mnt/persist/var/lib/ssh && sudo tee /mnt/persist/var/lib/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key > /dev/null && sudo chmod 600 /mnt/persist/var/lib/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key"
```

If all seems well, reboot Iridium.

### Secure Boot

> [!WARNING]
> Secure Boot isn't very securing if you don't have a UEFI password set.
> If you don't already have a UEFI password set, and you actually want to leverage the security benefits of Secure Boot, configure that password after following this section.
> Some UEFIs have a setting to allow the password to be reset by a hardware trick. Ensure you understand the implications of this and have your password backed up before disabling this.

Reboot into Iridium's UEFI, ensure Secure Boot is disabled, clear the current Secure Boot keys, apply your changes and reboot back into NixOS.

Once back in NixOS, log in / SSH in and run:

```bash
sudo sbctl enroll-keys --microsoft
```

> [!WARNING]
> `--microsoft` retains Microsoft's UEFI CA alongside your own keys. Required for most consumer motherboards that ship GPU option ROMs signed by Microsoft. Omit only if you are certain your firmware has no Microsoft-signed components.

Reboot into UEFI again and re-enable Secure Boot. Apply your changes, reboot back into NixOS, and verify the status of Secure Boot with:

```bash
sbctl status
```

### TPM2 automatic LUKS unlock

If you chose to properly set up Secure Boot, you may want to leverage TPM2 to automatically unlock Iridium's LUKS.

To best enable this feature, bind LUKS to the TPM against PCR 0+7 (firmware + Secure Boot state):

```bash
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=0+7 /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

Reboot and verify LUKS unlocks automatically without a passphrase prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> TPM2 enrollment changes PCR values, which invalidates libvirtd's TPM-bound encryption key.
> Iridium ships with libvirtd + virt-manager by default, so reset the key after enrollment:
> ```bash
> sudo rm /var/lib/libvirt/secrets/secrets-encryption-key
> sudo systemctl start libvirtd
> ```
