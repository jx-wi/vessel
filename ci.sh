# Local CI — runs the SAME checks as .github/workflows/flake-check.yml by pulling
# each step's `run:` script straight from that workflow, so the command list lives
# in exactly one place. Run before every commit.
#
# Safety: these `run:` scripts execute as your user with NO sandbox. If the workflow
# differs from origin/main (an unreviewed/unexpected change), the commands are shown
# and confirmation is required first — a silent edit to .github can't run behind your
# back. (A compromised origin/main is out of scope: it auto-deploys to root anyway.)
#
# `--inputs-from .` resolves every `nixpkgs#tool` against this flake's locked
# nixpkgs, so the tools are hash-pinned to flake.lock (no unpinned registry fetch).
